## Bit Diffusion - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04202">Bit Diffusion</a>, Hinton's group's attempt at discrete denoising diffusion, in Pytorch

It seems like they missed the mark for text, but the research direction still seems promising. I think a clean repository will do the research community a lot of benefits for those branching off from here.
